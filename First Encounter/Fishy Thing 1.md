This event forms the party. They are all mid-teens kids who get brought together by witnessing this relatively tame breach of justice. 

[Janitor](##Janitor) who is there illegally unbeknownst to players calls cops to report someone (turns out to be right wing nut job) smashing a bunch of car windows outside the insitution (liberal, democratic think Planned parenthood or even more grossly-neolib that raised ire with the right).

The players are either all in vicinity to catch windows breaking or are lured by the commotion of the cops trying to escalate with the poor guy who called em. 

The players might not be aware (could maybe use history check etc to uncover) why the [[#Janitor]] is being difficult. The cops want to take his name, ID (which he does not have), address etc.

[[Chiller NPC ("Dave?")]] will eventually come in and deescalate.
