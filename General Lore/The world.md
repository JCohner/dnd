* Normal-ish world. Except with DnD characteristics (races, powers, etc). 
* If players ask why this world is so similar to our own (police, politics, socioeconomics, \*culture), "You might find that specific forces have lead this world to develop into something very similar to our own"
	* Might be some caveat on use of telecomunnications technology, but it should have developed largely similar to our own to account for the many that do not have powers.
* The role of power in society is as captured as any other type of labor. At this point in neo-liberalism domination. For example it wasn't like adventuring parties on both sides of the [equivalent of WW2] didn't try end the war.
* Some small amount of power is normal, it power scales like population density of sports: best player in hometown, D1, the minors, the league with power-scale demarcations in each rank. 
* Whimsy and play have been taken out of power. Kids my do it but adults shoo them away from it. A demarcation of socioeconomic status, poor families by and large will try minimize children of higher power lest they be taken away; again its rare for this to happen in the first place and the family *may* use it as a get rich play (divisvely)
* Its fractal and reality happens at the edges
* Varied racial dynamics maybe largely stolen from 5e; however, "new" money component to it where some looked down upon races have made money and now serve the same interest as the oppressive class. 
	* You can call this white supremacy. But in the dnd setting its not so much racial its the desire uphold the "agreements" and partioning of the world made at the point of the sword and with tons of bloodshed to the massive determenet of the masses while all the while claiming this is fair and peace and rational. 
	* Its those who wish to "kill nature and have their way with her". Abstraction taken as truth and weaponized to their desired end. Pointsman-esque, we can know everything about the world. Stochastically and organically this summons evil magic. At the most extreme through terrain glyphs of office blocks and tropp formations and highway patterns.
